# Diabetes-Prediction-System
End-to-End Machine Learning project to predict diabetes using Python

# ü©∫ Diabetes Prediction System ‚Äì End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This project is an end-to-end machine learning system developed using Python to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on various medical features. The system demonstrates the complete ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation and prediction.

## üéØ Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can assist in the early detection of diabetes using clinical parameters such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, age, blood pressure, and other health metrics. It aims to provide a quick, data-driven assessment that can help in proactive medical care.

## üîß Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and handled missing values, normalized data, and encoded features if needed.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used visualizations to understand feature relationships and detect outliers.
3. **Model Selection:** Trained and evaluated multiple classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and XGBoost.
4. **Performance Evaluation:** Measured models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
5. **Final Prediction:** Implemented a prediction pipeline that allows users to input values and get real-time diabetes risk predictions.
