# Diabetes-Prediction-System
End-to-End Machine Learning project to predict diabetes using Python
# Diabetes Prediction System ‚Äì End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This is a complete end-to-end machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on medical input features. It includes EDA, multiple ML models, model evaluation, and prediction ‚Äì all in one script. It also generates synthetic data, so no external dataset is needed.

## üîß Features
- Data generation (if no CSV provided)
- EDA with plots
- Model training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, KNN, etc.
- Cross-validation, ROC, AUC, and confusion matrix
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Predict diabetes risk and provide risk level

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
```bash
python diabetes_prediction_system.py
